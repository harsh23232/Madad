Problem Identification

There is a significant gap between those in need of aid and individuals interested in community service due to the complexity and inaccessibility of volunteering. Many people, especially students and minors,
feel motivated to contribute but are unsure how to start. Paradoxically, while there is no shortage of people requiring help or NGOs seeking volunteers, barriers such as individual websites, 
lengthy registration processes, and a lack of streamlined connections make volunteering daunting.

For instance, food wastage and hunger coexist as persistent issues, despite the efforts of NGOs like the Robin Hood Army and Annakshetra, which collect and distribute surplus food. However, 
many people still go hungry due to fragmented efforts and the absence of a unified network. Platforms like GiveIndia list NGOs but fail to connect individuals directly with causes they align with.
The goal is to design a system that bridges this gap, creating a one-stop network to connect people requiring aid with those willing to help, including NGOs. The platform would simplify the process 
of finding nearby opportunities aligned with individual goals, benefiting students passionate about volunteering, NGODeveloping a highly interactive app, 'Madad,' that allows a person to donate food easily and enables individuals to volunteer at NGOs near them at their preferred times seeking support, and vulnerable groups such as the food insecure, beggars, 
and disabled individuals.

Solution Statement:
Developing an app which consists of databaseof all NGOâ€™s through which users can donatefood and also find volunteer work in theirlocality. This will bridge the gap between thosewho want to 
donate and those who are in need.

Developing an highly interactive app 'Madad' from which a person who wants to donate the food he can do it and a person who want to do voluntring at ngo's at his requested time can 
volunteer in their nerarby ngo's.
